1213,86,Montes 2007 Classic Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice. The mouthfeel is tannic, grabby and big, while the flavors of black cherry and raspberry are nice but generic. Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced.",12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Montes
1214,86,Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),"Here's a simple, standard Chardonnay that is more neutral than anything, but at this level that's really what one should expect.

1410,88,Tarapaca 2005 Zavala Red (Maipo Valley),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla.

1411,88,Tarapaca 2008 La Isla Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Tomato leaf and nettle aromas join with grapefruit and tropical fruit. This is both more pungent and rounder than the Reserva, with greater concentration and verve.",18.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Tarapaca

1567,86,Terrapura 2015 Pinot Noir (Chile),"For value-priced Pinot, give this its props for being fair and consistent with past vintages.

1851,89,Concha y Toro 2014 Marques de Casa Concha Carmenère (Peumo),"Cheesy smelling oak and slightly overripe fruit aromas are a little less than spotless on the nose.

1904,89,Matetic 2012 Corralillo Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Rich, oaky aromas of coconut and vanilla are matched by earthy, almost nutty berry and cassis scents.

2028,86,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2010 Los Vascos Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent and sweaty smelling, with nettle and other sharp aromas. Surprisingly, the palate is short on acidity so there's a flat feel along with green, salinic flavors that border on vegetal. For proof, there's a clear wave of asparagus to the finish. Not as good as in past years.",14.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
2065,87,De Martino 2015 Legado Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent briny citrus aromas announce a lean, tangy palate.

2160,84,De Martino 2015 Viejas Tinajas Muscat (Itata Valley),"This tan-colored Muscat was fermented and aged in clay amphora, hence the “viejas tinajas” name. Aromatically, this is strained and smells vaguely of apricot and citrus peel. The palate is drawing due to heavy skins contact during fermentation and aging, while a short set of bitter apricot flavors is more challenging than pleasurable. Better to wait for the 2016. This is past its prime.",43.0,Muscat,,,Itata Valley,Chile,De Martino
2164,84,Viña Chocalan 2016 Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),Yeasty aromas of white flowers and ham don't stir much interest. This feels medium in body and fairly bland.

2180,83,Famiglia Meschini 2015 Unoaked Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit are more in the Sauvignon Blanc field than your typical Chardonnay.

2183,86,Porta 2000 Chardonnay (Cachapoal Valley),"The gold luster is eye grabbing, and the nose doesn't back off as it yields cream, vanilla and toast atop tropical fruit.

2187,86,Calina 2000 Reserve - Cabernet Sauvignon/Carmenere Red (Maule Valley),"A straight shot down blackberry lane. The palate is all about the fruit; it's got lots of texture, and maybe even some tannins to shed. Finishes with gravel, herb and a certain meatiness.

2325,88,Autoritas 2013 Gran Reserva Shiraz (Colchagua Valley),"Jammy boysenberry aromas are a touch oaky. Loud acidity gives zest and ring to cherry, plum and raspberry flavors.

2391,86,Echeverria 2013 Classic Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Saline and basic citrus aromas feed into a fresh, light-bodied palate with citrus, lettuce and minerally flavors.

2476,81,Tres Palacios 2013 Reserve Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Green, soupy aromas of tomato are blatant and harsh.

2619,81,San Pedro 2013 Gato Negro Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"With little varietal character on the nose, this qualifies as a basic, plump white wine with mild fruit, oily notes and some bitterness.",7.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Central Valley,Chile,San Pedro
2621,81,Garces Silva 2012 Boya Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Odd aromas of pomegranate and grapefruit are off the grid. This is citric and austere in feel, with sour, herbal flavors mixed with oak. A minty, herbal, green finish raises questions.",22.0,Pinot Noir,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Garces Silva
2623,81,Chilensis 2012 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"Light and tropical on the nose, this is flabby on the palate and tastes dull and sweet, with a creamy aftertaste and low acidity.",10.0,Chardonnay,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Chilensis
2624,81,Vistamar 2012 Sepia Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"This perenially mediocre wine is a little worse in 2012. It smells blowsy, floral and strange, while in the mouth it's like oaky apple cider. Flavors of cider and faux oak are less than impressive, as is the overall balance.",12.0,Chardonnay,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Vistamar
2665,84,TerraNoble 2013 Gran Reserva White (Casablanca Valley),"If the blend of Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc isn't jarring enough, then the wine's combination of high acid and heavy oak should be. This smells like plywood and sawdust, while the palate is both racy and resiny. Oaky, toasty, bitter flavors of lemon and underripe nectarine hold onto a barrel-driven flavors on the finish.",18.0,White Blend,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,TerraNoble
2670,83,Tololo 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),"Cherry and berry aromas are a bit hot and saucy. This feels chunky and borderline sticky, with hard raspberry and plum flavors. This is marginal, even for basic commercial Cabernet.",10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Curicó Valley,Chile,Tololo
2672,83,Emiliana 2013 Natura Malbec (Rapel Valley),"Briary, herbal berry aromas take on a wet-dog scent. This feels shear and shrill, with high acidity and not much body. Sour black-plum flavors are highly herbal and borderline weedy, while a tart, scouring finish closes this out.",12.0,Malbec,,,Rapel Valley,Chile,Emiliana
2673,83,Falernia 2013 Reserva Pinot Noir (Elqui Valley),"Stalky, damp, funky aromas are not unusual for Elqui wines. This is mild in feel and registers as being in the Pinot Noir range. Rooty, bitter flavors are rustic and low on fruit. Heat on the finish is of no help.",14.0,Pinot Noir,,,Elqui Valley,Chile,Falernia
2675,83,Estampa 2014 Estate White (Colchagua Valley),"Bland, pithy citrus aromas come with notes of saline solution and pool water.

2676,83,François Lurton 2013 Hacienda Araucano Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Earthy, leathery berry and mushroom aromas don't stir much interest.

2677,83,Chilcas 2013 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Blatant aromas of popcorn don't allow for much fruit expression on the nose. This is heavy and lacking in vitality. Flavors of toast, burnt wood, barrel resin and tropical fruits finish soft.",12.0,Chardonnay,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Chilcas
2679,83,Quintay 2014 Q Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Red-berry aromas are damp, mulchy and not fully fresh. On the palate, this wine feels sticky, while flavors of briny, herbal red-berry fruits turn salty on the finish.",20.0,Pinot Noir,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Quintay
2682,83,Tricky Rabbit 2015 Reserva Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"There's nothing too tricky about this dilute, mealy smelling Sauvignon Blanc that's blended with 10% Carmenère for a reason we can't explain. With drawing white-grape tannins, this tastes green and citrusy, with a scallion note to the finish.",12.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Tricky Rabbit
2684,83,Falernia 2014 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),"Aromas of orange and tangerine are oily on the nose. Melon, papaya and almond-skin flavors end with creamy lees notes that give way to bitterness on a dilute finish.",9.0,Pedro Ximénez,,,Elqui Valley,Chile,Falernia
2685,83,Chono 2015 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This opens like an exploding hand grenade filled with pyrazines and jalapeño extract. The narrow, acidic palate is lacking in depth, but at least it's fresh. Briny, green flavors of jalapeño and bell peppers never let go, while the finish is tart and green, with a lasting note of bell pepper.",13.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Chono
2916,86,Calcu 2012 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Plum and berry aromas come with a floral accent. This feels raw and a touch abrasive, with woody, saucy flavors of berry fruits and plum. The oaky, heavily spiced finish brings a grippy tannic feel.",14.0,Carmenère,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Calcu
2922,86,Santa Ema 2014 Select Terroir Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp, oaky and scratchy, but overall this opens well.

3204,86,Santa Luz 2015 Gran Reserva Corte Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Grapy berry and raisin aromas include notes of baking spices.

3210,86,Finca Patagonia 2015 Expedicion Syrah (Maule Valley),"Bright but basic plum, spice and leather aromas are uncomplicated. This feels grabby and rugged, with chewy tannins.

3213,86,Montes 2016 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa),"Cool-climate pyrazinic aromas are punchy and feline. This feels good but weaker and more dilute than in most years. Briny, pickled citrus flavors follow the nose, while this ends lean and green but solid enough.",13.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Aconcagua Costa,Chile,Montes
3214,86,Santa Rita 2015 120 Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),"Grassy, slightly green aromas are fresh and suggest cactus pad. This is easy on the palate, with flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs, such as tarragon and rosemary. A crisp finish is just solid enough to maintain integrity.",8.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Santa Rita
3227,86,Oveja Negra 2012 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Spiced plum, vanilla and sandalwood aromas add up to something nice. This feels good enough, with nothing demanding about the palate. Spicy berry and olive flavors are typical of the variety, while this feels dry and tastes a bit woody on the finish.",11.0,Carmenère,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Oveja Negra
3228,86,Pura 8 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Lanolin and squash aromas indicate that this is fading. The palate is wide and fleshy but lacking in a focal point. Flavors of spiced pumpkin and aged apple are a bit like holiday pie, while modest acidity on the finish ensures that this is bland on the exit.",16.0,Chardonnay,,,Rapel Valley,Chile,Pura 8
3364,87,Carmen 2014 Gran Reserva Los Quillayes Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Heavy oak on the nose means aromas of pencil lead, wet cement and blacktop are in the lead. This wine feels resiny and tannic, with a similar woody flavor accenting herbal black fruit. Although this is a good Cabernet, it's quite oaky.",19.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Carmen
3381,88,Polkura 2008 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Very sweet and lush on the nose, and teetering on overripe due to prune and raisin aromas. The palate, meanwhile, is more narrow than you might expect, with big tannins and extract. Tastes of black plum, blackberry and herbal notes. A ripe, loud wine that's a little clumsy but definitely big and fruity. 200 cases made.",23.0,Malbec,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Polkura
3392,90,Montes 2008 Limited Selection Leyda Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth, it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.",16.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Montes
3393,90,Odfjell 2004 Orzada Cabernet Franc (Maule Valley),"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal, leafy, tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket.",20.0,Cabernet Franc,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Odfjell
3394,90,Errazuriz 2005 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley),"The best Don Max in quite some time. After too many herbal-green vintages, the 2005 is ripe, rich and well woven. The bouquet shows hickory, roasted plum, chocolate, vanilla and peanut. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice. Finishes with a dash of caramel and earthy fruit leftovers. Honest, rugged and ready, but ageable for at least another 3–4 years.",65.0,Red Blend,,,Aconcagua Valley,Chile,Errazuriz
3399,90,Concha y Toro 2006 Marques de Casa Concha Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"At over $20 the brand's Best Buy days are behind it, but this Cabernet still unfolds in serious but elegant form. The nose is dusty and dark, with cassis and blackberry aromas. Meanwhile, the feel is juicy and fresh, and the palate is just sizable enough. Flavors of cassis, chocolate and coconut are modern and friendly, while the finish of cocoa, mocha and marmalade is exciting.",21.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Puente Alto,Chile,Concha y Toro
3408,90,Santa Rita 2006 Medalla Real Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on, so the plum, berry, coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins.",20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Rita
3429,89,Santa Ema 2012 Amplus Old Vine Carignan (Maule Valley),"Rich, chocolaty, toasty aromas of lactic oak and vanilla match red-fruit scents of raspberry and strawberry. This is lively on the palate, with an acidic pulse. Flavors of raw oak, creamy vanilla, plum and boysenberry finish overtly woody, with a lasting flavor of oak grain. Drink through 2018.",24.0,Carignan,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Santa Ema
3473,90,Cousiño-Macul 2006 Lota Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Displays a lot of Macul-driven eucalyptus on the nose, but also leather, licorice and herb aromas. The color is dark, and the structure and tannins are both firm. Tastes of powerful cassis and blackberry and shows concentration. Finishes thick, smooth and a touch syrupy. Drink now through 2014.",85.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Cousiño-Macul
3501,90,Caliboro Estate 2006 Erasmo Red (Maule Valley),"A little lean and fiery from nose to tail, but amid all the heavyweights coming from Chile that might be a good thing. The palate is tight, acidic and fresh, with an Old World mouthfeel and flavors of dried berry, earth, tobacco and spice. Snappy and crisp on the finish, with a final wave of propelling acidity. Drink now through 2014.",30.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Caliboro Estate
3502,86,Miguel Torres 2012 Santa Digna Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Solid but flat aromas of olive and leafy berry fruits introduce a midland palate of moderate bounce and average body. Raspberry, plum, currant and herbal flavors finish fresh, but also woody and slightly bitter in taste.",12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Central Valley,Chile,Miguel Torres
3510,86,Discreto 2012 Gran Reserva Red (Sagrada Familia),"Spicy, dry aromas of tobacco, campfire, herbs and berry fruits lead to a raw, oaky palate of plum, cassis and woody, lemony flavors. A middle-of-the-road finish with heat tastes like what came before it. The blend is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",14.0,Red Blend,,,Sagrada Familia,Chile,Discreto
3523,86,Santa Alicia 2013 Gran Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"This Merlot gets going with scratchy berry and plum aromas that come alongside roasted overtones. Choppy and tannic on the palate, this is short on flavors, with baked, loamy berry notes leading to a lightly herbal, briny tasting finish.",15.0,Merlot,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Alicia
3531,86,François Lurton 2013 Humo Blanco Gran Cuvée Pinot Noir (Lolol Valley),"Humo Blanco means “white smoke,” and the name applies to the daily morning fog that spreads over the Lolol area where this comes from. Leathery, earthy aromas of cherry and plum are ripe, while the palate is tannic and rubbery. Earthy cherry and plum flavors finish lasting and potent.",25.0,Pinot Noir,,,Lolol Valley,Chile,François Lurton
3619,87,Veramonte 2012 Ritual Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"With yeasty aromas of Animal Crackers, vanilla and pear, this is more warm, soft and sweet than in the past. The year's warm characteristics are draped all over the palate, which is soft and wide. Flavors of creamy white fruits and vanilla finish with lychee and grapefruit. This lacks some spine and vivacity but will be good through the end of the year.",20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Veramonte
3620,87,Viña Santa Cruz 2007 Chamán Gran Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"This earthy, concentrated Malbec is dense on the nose, with herbal flavors of blackberry, spice and heat. A toasty finish carries a choppy feel and fresh acidity, while the finish tastes toasty but doesn't rise up or improve. Overall, this is perfectly good but not complex. Drink now.",25.0,Malbec,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Viña Santa Cruz
3632,87,Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained.

3638,87,La Playa 2011 Axel Syrah (Limarí Valley),"This Syrah begins with subtle, mellow aromas of herbs and black fruits.

This is solid but regular on the finish, where herbal flavors are slightly toasted and show some heat.",17.0,Syrah,,,Limarí Valley,Chile,La Playa
3932,86,Chilcas 2013 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Concentrated aromas of licorice, mocha and generic black fruits are low on elegance.

Expect a saucy, herbal aftertaste.",19.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Chilcas
3942,86,Santa Alicia 2013 Gran Reserva de Los Andes Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Gritty, leathery aromas register as less than fully ripe. In the mouth, this Cabernet is a touch biting. Limited cherry and plum flavors come with burnt, herbal notes, while an earthy finish tastes of salt and chocolate.",15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Alicia
3944,86,Luis Felipe Edwards 2013 Marea Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Leafy, scratchy aromas of dried plum and raspberry give way to lemony, grainy oak scents. This is medium bodied, tightly wound and tastes of dried red fruits mixed with cocoa powder. A spicy, dry, crisp finish reinforces the wine's limitations.",25.0,Pinot Noir,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Luis Felipe Edwards
3951,86,Concha y Toro 2013 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Carmenère (Central Valley),"Black cherry, blackberry, olive and gritty oak aromas feed into a scratchy palate with forceful acidity.

3953,86,Viña Casablanca 2014 Cefiro Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of olive, green herbs, mixed spices and black plum set up a full, grabby palate.

3954,86,Luma Chequén 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Earthy berry, olive and latex aromas are sleepy and chunky. In the mouth, however, this is more grating and alive. Flavors of earthy, salty plum and raspberry finish similarly, with bold acidity, liveliness and a salty after­taste.",15.0,Carmenère,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Luma Chequén
3964,87,Undurraga 2016 Sibaris Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus, bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity.",15.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Undurraga
3974,87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Costa),"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.",16.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,,,Colchagua Costa,Chile,Montes
3975,87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Costa),"Dusty raspberry and plum aromas show a note of Band-Aid. This feels creamy and full, with black cherry, chocolate and oak flavors.

3985,87,Viña Marty 2013 Ilaia Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Solid berry aromas don't go crazy with the oak, spice or herbal components. A chunky pulpy palate is a bit soft, while peppery herbal animal notes comfortably work their way into core blackberry flavors. Flavors of herbal fruits and cured meats lend quality to the finish.",11.0,Carmenère,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Viña Marty
3994,92,Concha y Toro 2003 Carmín de Peumo Carmenère (Peumo),"Setting a new high bar for Carmenère is this luxury version from Concha y Toro's Cachapoal vineyard. And while it deserves to be drunk sooner than later, we recommend it for the best steak you grill this year. It's a strapped, juicy wine with tons of coffee, chocolate and berry essence. It's too hard or layered, so get at it soon for its up-front fruit and character.",74.0,Carmenère,,,Peumo,Chile,Concha y Toro
3995,92,Concha y Toro 2004 Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.",50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Puente Alto,Chile,Concha y Toro
3996,92,Viu Manent 2005 Single Vineyard San Carlos Estate Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"This score for a $22 Chilean Malbec may cause you to do a double-take, but this is really a great wine. The nose is chock full of berry aromas with earth and leather riding shotgun. Flavors and finishing notes of chocolate truffles, espresso, berry syrup and mocha sum it up. The structure is here, as is the core acidity. This wine has everything. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.",22.0,Malbec,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Viu Manent
4012,86,Casa Silva 2011 Angostura Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"This wine smells subtly of hickory and resin but is otherwise neutral on the nose.

This is a plump, oaky, honeyed style of Chardonnay.",14.0,Chardonnay,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Casa Silva
4021,86,William Cole 2011 Columbine Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Cool and green smelling, with briny notes and whiffs of green pepper and sea foam, this shows intensity, while the flavors veer toward lime, passion fruit and green herb. It's nervy and tasty on the finish.",16.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,William Cole
4023,86,Montes 2010 Alpha Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"On the nose, there are cider, oak and baked corn notes. The palate is full of oak and resin flavors that prevent the fruit from emerging immediately. It tastes of hickory, apple and melon on the palate and finish.",22.0,Chardonnay,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Montes
4025,86,oops 2011 Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Although it's not very aromatic, the nose on this wine is easygoing, with mild peach and apple aromas. It feels fresh and medium bodied, with apple, peach and melony flavors, the latter perhaps due to the blend's 14% white Carmenère. It shows mellow oak notes and latent acidity on the finish.",10.0,Chardonnay,,,Central Valley,Chile,oops
4068,92,Undurraga 2013 Vigno Old Vines Dry-Farmed Red (Maule Valley),"Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.",35.0,Red Blend,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Undurraga
4156,83,Calcu 2009 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"A funky nose of wet dog and medicinal cherry is no place you want to begin. The palate is high in acidity and scratchy, with tart plum, berry and cheek-starching tannins. Tastes reasonably good but fails in the bouquet and mouthfeel departments.",12.0,Malbec,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Calcu
4158,83,Cantora 2009 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"The nose is herbal and drawn but offers varietally correct cherry, berry and spice aromas. The wine runs ultracrisp and sheering in the mouth, with tart redfruit and herbal flavors of olive and mint. Seems more sharp and acidic than ideal.",10.0,Carmenère,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Cantora
4162,83,Chilensis 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"Tropical notes on the nose are as good as it gets; otherwise it smells like air freshener. In the mouth, it's waxy and flat, with bland apple and vanilla flavors. Finishes pithy.",12.0,Chardonnay,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Chilensis
4167,82,Chilcas 2009 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Generic and monotone on the nose. The palate is nothing more than wet and chunky, while the flavors are soft, sweet and candied, with vanilla and toffee overriding any fruit.

4168,82,Viu Manent 2010 Secreto de Viu Manent Viognier (Colchagua Valley),"Barely noticeable lime and orange aromas sit mute on the nose, which is reduced and artificial smelling. The palate has a hard feel and generic flavors of white fruits. Amid sweetness there's a chemical bitterness. Not one of this winery's better products.",14.0,Viognier,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Viu Manent
4170,82,Miguel Torres 2009 Cordillera Reserva Privada Barrel Fermented Chardonnay-Viognier (Chile),"Big and gold, with aromas of corn, sweat and vegetal white fruits. This is soft, dull and rich stuff, with an oaky, dry palate of apricot and papaya.

4482,88,Cono Sur 2014 Organic Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley),"Dry, spicy, earthy red-fruit aromas lead to a fresh palate with good body.

5679,83,Château Los Boldos 2012 Cuvée Tradition Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Light in color, light in aromas, light in flavor... that pretty much describes this decent but rudimentary Chardonnay.

5684,83,Carma 2010 Estate Grown Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Soft aromas of raisin and prune lack vitality and indicate what's to come.

5685,83,Concha y Toro 2011 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"This is a round, creamy, soft Chardonnay with resiny aromas.

5799,84,Torres 2012 Escaleras de Empedrado Pinot Noir (Maule Valley),"Scattered aromas of horseradish, cotton candy and vinegar are all over the map but don't convey varietal character or purity. This new wine from terraced vineyards in deep, rural Maule feels clipped, with heavy tannins. Mixed berry flavors are bitter and rubbery, and the finish is grabby and awkward. This is a first release; suffice it to say it needs more work to justify its price.",100.0,Pinot Noir,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Torres
5800,84,Apaltagua 2015 Reserva Rosé (Maule Valley),"Super light in color, with aromas of grape skins, nectarine and briny seashell, this rosé from Carmenère feels highly citric and shearing.

5810,84,Montes 2014 Twins Red (Colchagua Valley),"Heavy aromas of oak, char and syrupy berry fruits don't smell entirely natural. This feels tannic and scratchy, with missing parts.

5856,93,Concha y Toro 2005 Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"This comes across as the best Don Melchor that Concha y Toro has produced, and at $69 it should be.

5870,92,Concha y Toro 2005 Terrunyo Block: Las Terrazas Cabernet Sauvignon (Pirque),"A little rubbery and tough on first sniff, but this pedigreed Chilean Cab settles with airing and soon shows exciting, fully ripe raspberry, cassis and blackberry flavors.

Ready to go now but should hold steady for another three years.",37.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Pirque,Chile,Concha y Toro
5924,83,Haras 2008 Estate Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),"Stemmy, stalky aromas cloud over dilute fruit notes, while the palate is on the acidic side, which causes citrus and pithy peach flavors.

5926,83,Santa Ema 2007 Barrel Select Reserve Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley),"Opens with generic red fruit and candy aromas, but the palate is overtly acidic, which causes a sourness to go with candied, medicinal berry fruit flavors.

5930,83,Luis Felipe Edwards 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Herbal, punchy aromas start it off, and the palate has strong acids and rubbery tannins in support of herbal, red fruit flavors that suggest rhubarb. Strains to show much ripeness.",10.0,Carmenère,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Luis Felipe Edwards
5937,87,Chilcas 2009 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Smells like Italian herbs, dry red fruits and tomato sauce, or in other words, a nice pizza.

Not super spicy or complex, but still tasty and varietally correct.",13.0,Carmenère,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Chilcas
5963,88,Casa Silva 2009 Los Lingues Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"As usual for Casa Silva, this Carmenère is foreceful, minty, herbal and spunky on the nose, with a bold fruit aroma.

This is a sexy, polished, dark-tinted wine to drink through 2022.",54.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Viña el Principal
8388,87,Leyda 2015 Lot 5 Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of starched sheets and lanolin show a hint of apple. This feels rather lean and similar to soda: there isn't much body to it. Tropical melony flavors are oaky, and the finish turns downright woody and sweet like canned pineapple.",40.0,Chardonnay,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Leyda
8398,87,Indomita 2015 Zardoz Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Although this smells raw, woody and even a bit citric, sometimes a red wine that's not over the top is in order, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend fits that bill. A tight lean racy palate offers flavors of red citric fruits, oak and herbs. Barrel spice is dominant on a tight energetic finish.",25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Indomita
8401,87,Balduzzi 2016 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Snappy grapefruit and tangerine aromas are clean and crisp. That also describes the palate on this Maule Valley SB. Fairly intense flavors of lemon-lime and grapefruit cruise across a racy, unbroken finish.",11.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Balduzzi
8410,87,Cono Sur 2015 Reserva Especial Pinot Noir (San Antonio),"Earthy spicy aromas of tea and leather frame herbal berry and cherry notes. This has a fresh jumpy palate and snappy flavors of spiced pie cherry, plum and oak-based vanilla. A bit of saltiness rises up on a juicy, racy finish.",15.0,Pinot Noir,,,San Antonio,Chile,Cono Sur
8419,89,Matetic 2010 EQ Chardonnay (San Antonio),"Toasty and mellow on the nose, with aromas of baked apple and papaya. It feels good, with lively acidity that boosts the wine's core texture. Meanwhile, flavors of toasted apple and quince get richness from vanilla and oak accents. Long, viscous and baked on the finish.",26.0,Chardonnay,,,San Antonio,Chile,Matetic
8432,89,Concha y Toro 2009 Terrunyo Entre Cordilleras Peumo Vineyard Carmenère (Peumo),"This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit.

8440,89,Viña Casablanca 2010 Nimbus Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Baked red-fruit aromas come with tea, orange peel, rubber and creamy milk-chocolate accents.

This is a balanced wine that's fresh and ready to drink.",23.0,Pinot Noir,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Viña Casablanca
8490,88,Viñedos Organicos Emiliana 2007 Natura Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"This is a fulfilling unoaked, organic wine from Chile's cool Casablanca Valley. This quaffable Chard focuses on pure citrus, grapefruit and peach flavors. There's a touch of natural sweetness but with no oak there's no butter, fat or flab. Breaks the mold and opens the door to a whole other style of Chardonnay.",10.0,Chardonnay,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Viñedos Organicos Emiliana
8503,88,Concha y Toro 2005 Amelia Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Sort of heavy, with touches of baked corn and hay. But it also has nice baked apple flavors and pretty good oak. On the finish, there's vanilla, almond, citrus and apple, and then very late comes hazelnut and even more vanilla. Drink now; it's not going to last much longer.",35.0,Chardonnay,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Concha y Toro
8511,90,Undurraga 2008 Altazor Red (Maipo Valley),"Fiery on first blush, this then displays aromas of plum, leather, tobacco and cheesy oak. It feels fresh and not the least bit fat or flabby, with cassis, raspberry, olive, cocoa and mint flavors. The finish is composed, dry and lightly herbal. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Carignan.",60.0,Red Blend,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Undurraga
8514,90,Viña Requingua 2007 Potro de Piedra Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Curicó Valley),"A classic Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon with aromas of lemon peel, olive and leafy fruit. It shows major structure, tannic framework and dry, herbal flavors of cassis and cherry. Long, fruity, toasty and just slightly rustic. Drink now–2012.",25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,,,Curicó Valley,Chile,Viña Requingua
8565,84,G7 2015 The 7th Generation Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Aromas of papaya and melon are hit with a slight sulfuric note. This feels plump, with mild citric acidity. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and grass are green and bright, but turn pithy on the finish.",8.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Central Valley,Chile,G7
8578,83,Mancura 2012 Reserva Guardián Carignan (Maule Valley),"A hard, grinding scent of road tar is out front on a mostly fruitless nose. This feels choppy and in search of balance. Gritty, herbaceous plum flavors finish with only modest fruit notes.",12.0,Carignan,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Mancura
8580,83,G7 2015 The 7th Generation Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Scents of tropical of mango and banana are offset by a hint of citrus. Creamy and soft on the palate, this tastes of lime and green herbs. A banana flavor carries the finish.",10.0,Chardonnay,,,Central Valley,Chile,G7
8584,83,François Lurton 2014 Hacienda Araucano Clos de Lolol White (Lolol Valley),"For this critic, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay isn't working. For starters, it's severely oaked, such that the palate feels creamy, sticky and heavy. Flavors of oak resin and mushy melon end flat, sticky and cloying.",20.0,White Blend,,,Lolol Valley,Chile,François Lurton
8633,82,Polkura 2012 Aylin Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Bell pepper and cactus aromas announce greenness. It's also dilute in texture, with cucumber and arugula flavors. Not only is this high on pyrazines, it's past its prime.",14.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Polkura
8634,82,Alta Delta 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),"Earthy, foresty, green aromas precede a round palate with stemmy flavors matched by a burnt, lightly bitter aftertaste.",11.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Curicó Valley,Chile,Alta Delta
8707,92,Alcance 2013 Bravura Red (Maipo Valley),"On the nose, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Petit Verdot smells of spicy berry fruits and black plum along with chocolate and cedar. The palate is a touch drawing and tannic, but in no way harsh or impeding. Spicy black-fruit flavors include notes of olive and herbs, while the finish delivers more of the same. Drink through 2022.",50.0,Red Blend,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Alcance
8754,89,Emiliana 2007 Novas Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Central Valley),"Rich and baked smelling, with hints of marzipan, tobacco, earth and black fruits. Feels chewy and deep, with fresh acidity and bright cassis, black cherry and blackberry flavors touched up by chocolate and spice. Penetrating and choppy on the finish; 70% Cabernet with 30% Merlot. Drink now through 2013.",17.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,,,Central Valley,Chile,Emiliana
8848,87,Santa Carolina 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of passion fruit, grapefruit, lime and bell pepper are textbook for the region. This feels fresh as a whistle, with pyrazine-led bell pepper, green bean and lime flavors. Additional notes of bell pepper, with hints of white pepper drive the finish on this crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc.",11.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Santa Carolina
8849,87,Santa Ema 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Black-fruit aromas of cassis and boysenberry are not overdone nor overoaked. Thie palate feels somewhat spiky and acidic, with a tartaric bite. A flavor profile comprised of salty berry fruits finishes briny and herbal, with good weight and balance.",15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Ema
8857,87,Mancura 2012 Gran Reserva Red (Casablanca Valley),"Herbal, briary raspberry and plum aromas come with a green hint of eucalyptus as well as leather. This Syrah-led blend is grabby and showing tannic grip. Flavors of briny red fruits, herbal notes and olive end with roasted overtones and rubbery tannins.",16.0,Red Blend,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Mancura
8867,87,Viña Maipo 2013 Gran Devoción Red (Maule Valley),"Traditional Maipo Valley aromas of eucalyptus and wild herbs form the opening, while spicy, oaky shadings fill out the bouquet on this Cabernet-led blend that contains 15% Syrah. A full, oaky palate is lively, while heavily herbal, briny flavors of olive and tobacco confirm the wine's Chilean character.",18.0,Red Blend,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Viña Maipo
9035,87,Morandé 2001 Terrarum Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Rustic, as Carmenère should be, this single-valley offering is a good drink-with-barbecue bet. Bark, dark berries and chocolatey aromas show on the nose; earth and black fruit dominate the full, low-acid palate. Woodsy, briary notes and ample spice give oomph to the juicy berry finish.",9.0,Carmenère,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Morandé
9115,88,Indomita 2011 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Leathery, mossy aromas of dark-berry fruits lead to a bright, energetic, acid-driven palate with quality flavors of plum and spiced blackberry. This has zest and savory notes on the finish, and overall it's fresh in feel, tasty and not too demanding.",,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Indomita
9145,86,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Summit 2900 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Rapel Valley),"Dry, spicy, leathery aromas are herbal but solid. This feels full and balanced but rudimentary, with cherry, cassis, chocolate and herbal flavors. A finish of dark-fruit flavors comes with overt oak notes, peppery spice and heat.",13.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Rapel Valley,Chile,Bodega Volcanes de Chile
9210,82,Indomita 2009 Duette Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Scratchy and dry on the nose, this turns lean and borderline sour in the mouth, with acidity running the show. Very zesty, with mild oak influence, this is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Carmenère.",20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Indomita
9215,82,Casa Silva 2009 Angostura Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This is charred and burnt smelling, with a rubbery, hickory aroma that covers up the wine's cherry and berry scents. The palate bears flavors of raspberry, pie cherry and green herb, finishing quick as a flash, with tannic residue.",22.0,Merlot,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Casa Silva
9217,82,Viña La Rosa 2011 La Palma Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley),"Basic citrus and apple aromas lead to a round palate that won't stay fresh for much longer. It tastes melony and green, with lettuce flavors and a flat finish.",9.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Cachapoal Valley,Chile,Viña La Rosa
9220,81,Arauco 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"This is nearly indistinguishable from Arauco's standard 82-point 2011 Sauvignon Blanc, smelling stalky, with zero pungency or varietal character. It shows lemony acids, but that's about all.",14.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Central Valley,Chile,Arauco
9222,81,Santa Ema 2011 Selected Terroir Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Other than notes of white flowers and green herbs on the nose, this wine is all about canned peas and beans. The palate has texture and flesh, but the flavors are vegetal.",9.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Ema
9226,80,Viña el Aromo 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"This is oily and strained on the nose and fleshy in the mouth. It tastes herbal and quasi weedy, with a matchstick note on the finish.",9.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Viña el Aromo
9316,81,Kon Tiki 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Leesy vanilla aromas are bland and don't amount to much. The palate follows suit, with additional briny melon flavors.",13.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Central Valley,Chile,Kon Tiki
9317,81,Autoritas 2014 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),Powdery bath-soap aromas are odd on the nose. The mealy palate boasts flavors of bitter melon and papaya.,11.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Autoritas
9318,81,Viña Casas Patronales 2013 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"This is overtly rustic, roasted, leathery and strange on the nose. A wide but wayward palate seems sluggish, while rubbery black-fruit and burnt-wood flavors finish with murky berry tones.",10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Viña Casas Patronales
9319,81,Terra Andina 2012 Bold Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.",10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Central Valley,Chile,Terra Andina
9324,81,Estampa 2014 Fina Reserva Ensamblaje Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Colchagua Valley),"Pickled, briny aromas lead to a palate defined only by pithy citrus fruit. This tastes mostly of bitter citrus, while the finish brings herbacious tones.",19.0,White Blend,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Estampa
9330,80,Rai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"This is fleshy and dilute up front, then heavy and globular in feel. Pickled melon and vegetal stone-fruit flavors finish weak.",11.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Central Valley,Chile,Rai
9331,80,Teillery 2014 Organic Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.",14.0,Carmenère,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Teillery
9730,89,Casas del Toqui 2010 Terroir Selection Gran Reserva Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Piercing on the nose, with aromas of cola, graphite, juniper and blackberry. Feels thick, with meaty flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, herb and flower notes. Layered and relatively long on the finish. Impressive for under-$20 Chilean Syrah, with complexity and sauvage notes.",16.0,Syrah,,,Cachapoal Valley,Chile,Casas del Toqui
9746,89,Viña Casablanca 2009 Nimbus Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley),"Opens with lactic, slightly raisiny aromas that turn oakier and creamier with airing. Dense, rubbery and intense on the tongue, with dark flavors of blackberry and herb in the middle. Finishes long, earthy and slightly herbal, with tannic bite and grip. Drink now through 2014.",23.0,Syrah,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Viña Casablanca
9747,89,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Light and fresh up front, with lychee, passion fruit and wet stone aromas. Feels good and balanced as if offers a nice mix of textured fruit and minerally acidity. Flavors of green melon, passion fruit, lime and green herbs come straight from central casting. Perfect for summer drinking.",13.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Viña Casablanca
9792,91,Montes 2007 Alpha M Red (Santa Cruz),"Impressive as always, with dense, meaty aromas of baked black fruits, compost and dried cheese. The palate is thick to the max, with chocolate, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. Ultrarich on the finish, with warmth and density. Once again ""M"" shows how deep and rewarding high-end Chilean reds can be. Drink now through 2015.",95.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,,Santa Cruz,Chile,Montes
9804,91,Aresti 2007 Family Collection Red (Curicó Valley),"This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations. It's piercing and potent up front, with cigar box, mocha, toast and coffee aromas in addition to fine flavors of tobacco, cassis, vanilla and lightly baked berry and cassis. Finishes wavy and long; 50% Syrah along with Merlot, Cab and Carmenère.",24.0,Red Blend,,,Curicó Valley,Chile,Aresti
9824,82,Bossy Boots 2014 Reserva Merlot (Maule Valley),"Raw abrasive plum and berry aromas are grassy. This passable Merlot is rubbery and pinched in feel, with herbal generic berry flavors that finish with a weedy accent.",12.0,Merlot,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Bossy Boots
9827,82,Santa Ema 2014 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"From the outset this is woody and artificial in style. Aromas of milk chocolate and clove are strange and forced. In the mouth, this feels wiry but also gummy, with clove-heavy oak and tannic bite. In general, this is overly woody, candied and seemingly not natural.",14.0,Merlot,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Ema
9828,82,François Lurton 2015 Hacienda Araucano Clos de Lolol White (Lolol Valley),"This yellow-tinted blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay smells more like freshly waxed floorboards and wood resin than fruit. In the mouth, this is resiny and plump, with mild acidity. A weird set of woody, waxy flavors falls flat on the finish.",20.0,White Blend,,,Lolol Valley,Chile,François Lurton
9829,82,Apaltagua NV Extra Brut Costero Sparkling (San Antonio),"Grassy aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This is basic at best, lacking at worst. There's not much to the palate, while salty grassy grapefruit flavors fail to stir excitement. An unfriendly note of onion appears on a tart green finish.",19.0,Sparkling Blend,,,San Antonio,Chile,Apaltagua
9830,82,Albamar 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Briny aromas of sauerkraut fail to make much of an impression. This is dull in feel, with bitter, fruitless flavors. On the finish, bitterness remains. Drinkable but with few positives.",12.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Albamar
9831,81,Echeverria 2016 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"With a strange pink color and powdery nondescript aromas, this is shapeless and lacking in structure. Weak bitter flavors are completely fruitless; overall this seems to be going nowhere good.",10.0,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Curicó Valley,Chile,Echeverria
9832,81,Valdivieso NV Brut Sparkling (Chile),"This tan-colored brut is outright oxidized and bready from front to tail. A foamy full palate is awkward, while this tastes yeasty and stale, as oxidized wines often do.",12.0,Sparkling Blend,,,Chile,Chile,Valdivieso
9833,81,Finca Patagonia 2015 Expedicion Pinot Noir (Maule Valley),"Aromas of chewing gum dust are not attractive. This feels flat, with zero edge and structure. Lightly oxidized flavors of generic berry leave one with nothing to latch on to.",12.0,Pinot Noir,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Finca Patagonia
9834,81,Santa Rita 2015 Secret Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Valley),"A blast of fake-smelling clove is the dominant aroma on this sticky Pinot Noir. Clove returns as the singular flavor, while the finish is woody but not toasty or classy. This is uniquely one-dimensional, but in the wrong way.",11.0,Pinot Noir,,,Central Valley,Chile,Santa Rita
9835,80,Casas del Toqui 2015 Barrel Series Reserva Pinot Noir (Cachapoal Valley),"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate.",14.0,Pinot Noir,,,Cachapoal Valley,Chile,Casas del Toqui
9836,80,Loma Larga 2011 Brut Nature Limited Edition Cabernet Franc (Casablanca Valley),"Other than a strange note of mustard, there's little to say about the nose of this brut nature Cab Franc. It tastes of sauerkraut and mustard, while the finish tastes pickled, with an infusion of vinegar.",30.0,Cabernet Franc,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Loma Larga
9876,86,Kingston Family 2010 Alazan Pinot Noir (Casablanca & Leyda Valleys),"Plum and cherry aromas turn herbal and piney with airing. Definitely a leaner, sharper Alazan than in the past, with body as well as piercing acidity. Black fruit flavors have an herbal undertone as the palate transitions to peppery spice. Bright and zingy; not much finish.",32.0,Pinot Noir,,,Casablanca & Leyda Valleys,Chile,Kingston Family
